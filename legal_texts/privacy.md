## 17. Content Analysis & Evidence Vault

**What We Analyze:** To provide our safety features, we analyze the content you choose to route through or share with EchoFort. This may include the audio of calls you record, the text of messages and emails, images, QR codes, and links.

**Why We Analyze It:** Our purpose is strictly limited to providing you with safety and security services. This includes:

- Detecting and alerting you to potential scams, fraud, and phishing attacks
- Identifying harassment, abuse, and bullying
- Flagging potentially harmful, violent, or extremist-style content for your awareness
- Enabling family safety features to protect children from harmful content

**What We Store (Evidence Vault):** When our systems detect high-risk content (such as a severe scam attempt or content with a high risk of violence) or when you explicitly enable evidence backup, we may store a record in your secure Evidence Vault. This record may include a copy of the content, the associated risk scores, and other metadata. This evidence is stored with a 7-year retention period to be available for your legal defense, to support complaints you may choose to file, or for our defense in case of disputes.

**Who Can Access It:** Your data is private. Access to the content in your Evidence Vault is strictly limited to:

- **You**, the user
- The designated **family owner**, in the case of a child or family account, for the purpose of ensuring the child safety
- Limited, authorized **EchoFort staff**, but only when you explicitly request support or legal assistance that requires access to this data

We do not share this data with third parties for marketing or advertising. We will only cooperate with law enforcement or government authorities upon receipt of a valid legal request, as detailed in our Law Enforcement Guidelines.

## 18. Children & Family Protection Notice

For accounts designated as child or family profiles, our content analysis features serve as safety filters to help protect children from online harms. These filters are designed to detect and alert parents or guardians to content that may encourage self-harm, promote violence, or contain extremist propaganda or other illegal material.

As a parent or guardian, you are informed that your child communications routed through EchoFort may be analyzed for these safety purposes. We encourage you to use these tools as part of a broader strategy of online safety, including open communication with your child and the use of other parental controls. You are responsible for configuring alerts and restrictions in accordance with your judgment and applicable local laws.
