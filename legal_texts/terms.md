## 15. AI Content Analysis & Safety Scores

To protect our users and community, EchoFort utilizes advanced automated systems, including artificial intelligence (AI), to analyze content that you process or share through our services. This includes, but is not limited to, calls, messages, images, emails, and links.

**Purpose of Analysis:** This analysis is conducted for the sole purpose of detecting and providing you with safety alerts regarding potential risks, such as:

- Scams, fraud, and phishing attempts
- Harassment, bullying, and abuse
- Potentially harmful, violent, or extremist-style content

**Nature of Predictions:** The outputs of this analysis, including risk scores, content categories, and safety alerts, are automated predictions and probabilistic assessments. They are provided for informational purposes to help you make safer decisions. They are not legal determinations, factual assertions, or official labels. EchoFort is not a court, a law enforcement agency, or a government authority, and our AI predictions do not represent a legal judgment on content legality.

**User Responsibility:** You remain solely responsible for your decisions and actions based on these predictions. It is your responsibility to independently verify information and, if you believe you have encountered illegal content or are in danger, to report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

## 16. No Promotion or Endorsement

EchoFort is a neutral safety platform. Our use of labels such as extremism, hate speech, or terrorism risk is based on automated, content-focused pattern detection and is applied solely for the purpose of user safety and risk awareness. EchoFort does not endorse, support, or promote any political, religious, or social ideology, organization, or belief.

## 17. Limitation of Liability for AI Predictions

While we strive to make our AI safety predictions as accurate as possible, they may be incorrect, incomplete, or misinterpreted. To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, EchoFort shall not be liable for any decisions, damages, or losses arising from your reliance on the risk scores, categories, or alerts provided by our service. You should not rely on EchoFort as your only source of truth or as a definitive assessment of any content safety or legality.
